    <h3>rants about my favorite things</h3>
<div class="box" id="Media">
<h3>Movies/Series:</h3>

<p><p><h4>Star Wars</h4>
<p>My Dad introduced me to the original trilogy when I was 5 I think? I immediately liked it and also spend a lot of time looking through his book about the first part of the prequels. This promted him to show me the prequels as well. Ive been a big prequel fan ever since. Also all the legends content? Great, even if not canon, I could spend days just looking through it. I personally play SWTOR quite often, and can only recommend it.
    </p></p></p>

<div class="box" id="Manga">
    <h3>Manga:</h3>
<p><p><h4>Bungo Stray Dogs</h4>
<p>The best manga in existence, you cannot convince me otherwise. Its just genuinely amazingly written and how the hell did asagiri get so many so hypertalented artists to work on it? I love the artstyle of the main series and the spinoffs so much its amazing. Its also the first manga i ever read. (I found it cuz of an edit on youtube shorts of the fyodor helicopter stabby stabby scene.)
    <p>The anime, on the other hand, is trash.</p></p></p></p>
<p><p><h4>Magical Girl Dandelion</h4>
<p>While not many chapters are out yet, right now I like the premise a lot! I drew so much fanart already :). But (Mild Spoiler) why oh why did alice die already 
    </p></p></p>
</div>
<div class="box" id="Music">
    <h3>Music:</h3>
<p><p><h4>Ado</h4>
<p>Ado's music is so so cool and I think shes got such an amazing voice. And, im no expert on this, but singing like that must be quite hard right? Its super impressive. 
    </p></p></p>
<p><p><h4>Particularly the Song "Villain" by Teniwoha</h4>
<p>Its so good, vocaloid and also a song bout being trans? I cant not like it. 
    </p></p></p>
    <p><p><h4>Seb Lowe</h4>
<p>I like political music, and its really good. I once listended to the song "A Westener walks into a Bar" for three hours straight. 
    </p></p></p>
</div>
<div class="box" id="Other">
<h3>Other Stuff:</h3>

<p><p><h4>Minecraft</h4>
<p>I was introduced to minecraft when I saw my neighbor playing the game when we were both 7 years old. Kid me was very jealous and spent half a year annoying my dad so he'd buy me minecraft pe. I still have some of my old worlds, i liked these blocks in which you could save structures, idk what theyre named in englisch, but anyways, i saved a blank room made out of quartz and used it to make endless skyscrapers with uniquely decorated apartments. That was really fun. I recently bought minecraft java after playing on bedrock for years, to be able to play on linux. I also joined the hackclub server.
    </p></p></p>
     <p><p><h4>Visual Novels</h4>
<p>These Horror visual novels you can find on itch.io, especially "Are you really a Vampire?". I especially like the notes in the code of that one. Im also working on a dating sim visual novel with KeyGame Studios, and why would i do that if i didnt like the type of game?
    </p></p></p>
<p><p><h4>Linux</h4>
<p>I spent way too much time customizing my own version of linux mint, with miku bootlogo and everything. Cinnamon is also amazing compared to whatever DE windows ten uses, I constantly change my theme/make my own its so fun. And now after a lot of work Ive got the coolest ideapad ever.
    </p></p></p>
       <p><p><a href="collection.html"> <h4>Collecting Things</h4></a>
<p>I collect keychains, star wars figurines, vhs tapes and books! Also Website decorations. Maybe you can find them? 
    </p></p></p>
    <p><p><h4>Color Schemes!</h4>
<p>Maybe youve already noticed that. I like colorscheme projects like catpuccin etc. On my personal website alone ive used the following: Dracula (The main page), Catpuccin (The Art Portfolio), Nord (The Blog Page), Solarized (The OC page), Tokio Night (This one!)
